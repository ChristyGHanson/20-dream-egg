                        <h3>Pleased to meet you. Welcome to my portfolio. </h3>
                        <p class="p">As a professional, I have a good range of experiences in social media marketing, content writing, and game design. I got my start in K-8 education where I taught 8th grade English in my hometown on the Navajo Nation. In 2020, I discovered my rigorous role as a community manager at <a href="https://www.7generationgames.com/">7 Generation Games</a>. This molded me into a highly effective marketing professional and creative consultant.</p>

                        <p class="p">At 7 Generation Games, I designed two cross-curricular online video games alongside a bright team of elementary students who were dipping their toes in game design. I collaborated with Native American educators, consultants, and artists to breathe life into my cultural narratives within the games. I marketed 7 Generation Games to educators via online trainings, conferences, and social media. Along the way I cultivated a strong connection to people of all ages with my creativity and cultural knowledge.</p>

                        <p class="p"> For the past three years, I became interested in honing my existing web content writing skills, but with the added benefit of Javascript and React. Last fall, I enrolled in the University of Washington full stack web development bootcamp and completed it this summer. I have also bolstered my existing skills in Agile teamwork, project planning, and technical writing through this bootcamp. My current strengths lie in front end web design and development.</p>

                        <p class="p">I want to share with you that I am a cultural fiber artist whose grandmother was a Navajo weaver. My passion in this cultural art form was only fueled by ravenous sheep and alpaca farms in New Mexico and Oregon. I am carrying on the art of Navajo weaving to support K-12 and adult education. Currently, I am under the tutelage of Barbara Teller Ornelas and Lynda Pete, who are both award-winning <a href="https://navajorugweavers.com/">seventh generation</a> weavers. Recently, I was awarded two scholarships to learn and revitalize Navajo rug weaving from the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona and the Idyllwild Arts Academy in southern California.</p></div>
